Version 1.3.7: May 5th 2016
- Fixed SuperRes as the upgrade was broken
- SuperRes 20-50% faster than previously

- Includes the x64 DLL
- Updated SuperRes and Super-xBR to the latest version
- SuperRes is now over 50% faster by using custom downscaler!

Version 1.3.5: January 13th 2016
- Combined all scripts into one file for simplicity
- Shortened some of the parameters
- SuperXBR: Removed ThirdPass argument, added MatrixIn and MatrixOut
- SuperXBR and SuperResXBR: Now does YUV to RGB color conversion

Version 1.3.4: January 7th 2016
- Shader.dll: It is now possible to set parameter as vectors with more than 4 values
- Super-xBR and SuperResXBR: Fixed image distortion.
- SuperResXBR: Added WidthOut, HeightOut, b and c to do a final Bicubic resize before reading from GPU, reducing memory transfers

Version 1.3.3: December 30th 2015
- Shader.dll: Added the option to copy clip data without processing by leaving Path empty
- Shader.dll: Fixed a bug where input textures were unecessarily copied for each command. This slightly increases performance and reduces CPU usage
- Added SuperResXBR, a hybrid between SuperRes and Super-xBR that runs both in the same command chain, reducing memory usage and improving performance
- SuperRes: Fixed a bug where YUV-RGB conversion was ignored when Convert=false
- SuperRes: Added ConvertYuv to specify whether to convert YUV-RGB data or not

Version 1.3.2: December 28th 2015
- Added FormatOut to all scripts to set output format
- Fixed SuperRes when using lsb_out
- Removed bogus "info" in Super-xBR

Version 1.3.1: December 6th 2015
- Added support to convert to/from DitherTools' Stack16 format
- All Precision parameters are now 2 by default to avoid confusion
- ConvertToShader/ConvertFromShader: now have 'lsb' argument. When true, it converts to/from Stack16 format. Only YV12 and YV24 are supported.
- ExecuteShader: Added Clip1Precision-Clip9Precision instead of PrecisionIn, allowing input clips with various precisions
- ExecuteShader: PrecisionOut is now OutputPrecision
- SuperRes: Added MatrixIn and MatrixOut arguments instead of srcMatrix601 which gives more flexibility for color matrix conversion
- SuperRes and Super-xBR: Added lsb_in, lsb_upscale and lsb_out to convert to/from Stack16 format
- SuperRes and Super-xBR: PrecisionIn replaced with Convert. When true, the source must be precision=2
- ColorMatrix601to709 is now ColorMatrixShader
- ColorMatrixShader: Added MatrixIn and MatrixOut arguments giving more flexibility for color matrix conversion

Version 1.3: December 1st 2015
- SuperRes distortion problems fixed. Colors should now be accurate.
- Shaders now use PrecisionIn=1 and convert frames to 16-bit on the GPU
- 10% performance increase and lowered memory usage
- Fixed SuperRes when using Softness parameter
- Overflow coordinates now use 'clamp'
- Fixed distortion line at the right and bottom of Super-xBR
- Fixed sub-pixel shift with Super-xBR when ThirdPass=false
- Super-xBR 'weight' argument renamed to 'sharpness'
- ConvertToFloat renamed to ConvertToShader, ConvertFromFloat renamed to ConvertFromShader
- ConvertToShader/ConvertFromShader, removed convertYuv argument
- ConvertToShader/ConvertFromShader, precision default is now 1
- All arguments now start with a uppercase letter
- Added PrecisionIn argument to SuperRes and Super-xBR. Set to 0 to call ConvertToShader within the shader; set to 1-3 if it is already converted.

Version 1.2.2: November 29th 2015
- For SuperRes, HLSL Bicubic downscaler is broken and has been disabled. Downscaling is now done in AviSynth
- There will be a performance hit and it will take a lot more memory, but the image will be good. Until HLSL Bicubic is fixed.

Version 1.2.1: November 28th 2015
- Fixed distortion bug introduced in last version when using PrecisionIn=1
- SuperRes, Super-xBR and ColorMatrix now use PrecisionIn=2 until the bug is corrected

Version 1.2: November 26th 2015
- Added precisionIn and precisionOut arguments to ExecuteShader, allowing converting data on the GPU
- SuperRes, Super-sBR and ColorMatrix scripts adapted to convert with precision=1 while doing the processing with precision=2
- Removed D3DCREATE_DISABLE_PSGP_THREADING flag from DirectX9 device
- Performance is similar, memory usage is slightly lower and CPU usage is considerably lower

Version 1.1: November 24th 2015
- Shader will now attempt open relative paths in the same folder as the DLL.
- Folder argument removed from SuperRes and Super-xBR. CSO files must be in the same folder as Shader.dll
- Added ColorMatrix.avsi for high bit dept color matrix conversion to avoid banding
- SuperRes now has srcMatrix601 argument allowing to convert color matrix while running SuperRes with no performance cost.
